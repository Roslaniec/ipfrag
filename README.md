Overview
========

ipfrag contains two extremely simple tools for experimenting with IPv4
fragmentation.

`fragment.py` fragments the IPv4 packets in a PCAP file and writes the
results to another PCAP file.

`defrag.py` simply does the reverse.

The scripts need scapy. Run `make` to get the requirements.
